# Google Earth Engine Python API Examples
A collection of [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) for [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) Python API.

You have to change the code in `authorize_ee.ipynb` to make it run. Unfortunately this changed with the new version of the GEE Python API. I'll fix it as soon as I have time for it.<br><br><br>

#### 001 Landcover Classfication for Landsat 8 TOA imagery
Classification Example for Landsat 8 including several vegetation indices and object feature extraction. Eventually you can't access the training data. In case you are interested in the training data, feel free to contact me.<br><br>
#### 002 Tasseled Cap Transformation for Landsat 8 TOA imagery
Tasseled Cap Transformation for Landsat 8 TOA imagery based on the scientfic work "Derivation of a tasselled cap transformation based on Landsat 8 at-satellite reflectance" by M.Baigab, L.Zhang, T.Shuai & Q.Tong (2014).<br><br>
